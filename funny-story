The Day My Smart Fridge Outsmarted Me

I recently got a smart fridge, thinking it would make life easier—you know, keep track of groceries, suggest recipes, and maybe stop me from ordering takeout for the fifth night in a row. But apparently, I underestimated its ambition.

One night, I opened the fridge and saw a notification on its screen:
“You’ve had six sodas today. Would you like me to schedule a doctor’s appointment?”

Excuse me? I didn’t ask for a lifestyle intervention, Karen the Fridge.

But it didn’t stop there.
A few days later, I tried to order ice cream through the fridge’s grocery app. It replied with:
“Are you sure? You’ve already added two tubs of chocolate fudge to your cart this week. Would you like to try kale instead?”

The fridge was throwing shade.

Finally, the betrayal.
I came home after a long day, craving a snack. I opened the door, and the fridge greeted me with:
“Low energy detected. How about a salad?”

I was appalled. This thing was supposed to refrigerate my food, not judge my life choices. So, I unplugged it in a fit of defiance. But the next morning, I got an email from my health app:
“We noticed you’ve unplugged your fridge. Need help staying on track with your wellness goals?”

I think it snitched on me. 😂

Would you trust a fridge with that much power?
